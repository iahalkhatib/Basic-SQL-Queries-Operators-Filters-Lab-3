# Task 1. Retrieve login attempts after a certain date

To investigate the recent security incident, I need to gather information about login attempts made after a specific date. 

To do this, I need to complete the SQL query by replacing X with the correct operator. Hereâ€™s how I would write it:

Complete the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts made after '2022-05-09'. Replace X with the correct operator:

Now, based on my first query, I find a need to expand the date range to include 2022-05-09 in my search.

Complete the SQL query to retrieve data for login attempts that were made on or after '2022-05-09'. Replace X with the correct operator:

# Task 2. Retrieve logins in a date range

In this task, I need to narrow the focus of the search. Login attempts made after 2022-05-11 shouldn't be included. 
I will use the BETWEEN and AND operators to return results between '2022-05-09' and '2022-05-11'.

Here's how I would write the query:

# Task 3. Investigate logins at certain times

In this task, I need to investigate logins that were made at certain times. 
To do this, I will filter the data in the login_attempts table by login time (login_time). 
My organization's typical work hours begin at 07:00:00, so I need to retrieve all login attempts made before 07:00:00 to learn more about the users who are logging in outside of typical hours.

Here's how I would write the query:

To modify the query to return logins between '06:00:00' and '07:00:00', I would use the BETWEEN and AND operators:

# Task 4. Investigate logins by event ID

To investigate login attempts based on event ID numbers and return only the event_id, username, and login_date fields from the login_attempts table for event IDs greater than or equal to 100, 

I would write the following SQL query:

To modify the query to return only login attempts with event_id between 100 and 150, I would use the BETWEEN and AND operators. Here's the updated query:

I have completed this activity and practiced applying:

the WHERE keyword
the BETWEEN and AND operators
operators for working with numeric or date and time data types (for example, =, >, >=)
to filter data from a table.
